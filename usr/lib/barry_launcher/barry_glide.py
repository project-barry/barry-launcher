"""barry_glide: glide typing for Barry Launcher's on-screen keyboard.

A glide is the finger's path over the letter keys. A word's ideal path runs
straight from key centre to key centre through its letters; the decoder
scores each dictionary word by how far the glide runs from that path (where
it went) and how unlike it is once both are scaled to the same size (what
it looked like), plus how common the word is, and returns the best few.

Candidates are the words that start near where the finger went down and end
near where it lifted, whose every letter the glide passed close to. Plain
Python: the filters leave a few hundred words to score.

Coordinates are the keyboard's own (any unit); keys maps each letter to its
key centre and key_size is a key's width in the same unit.
